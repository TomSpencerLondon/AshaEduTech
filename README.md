# AshaEduTech
The Asha London India Edtech Hackathon was a fun, inspiring day long 'Hack Day', designed to help solve rural unemployment in India. Key focus areas of the hack day will be the problem of job matching, where people are unaware of the work opportunities in their local area and elsewhere, and upskilling.

The day started at 10:30, when teams were formed, before teams have to pitch their solutions at 18:30 to our panel of judges, where a winning team was announced shortly after. 

Our team was awarded Â£2,000 for our solution which included a quiz and a platform for students and teachers to share questions and answers relating to the Indian Aser tests and also for preparation for Jobs.
